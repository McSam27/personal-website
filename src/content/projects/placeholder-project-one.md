This website. Built from scratch with Astro 5, React 19 islands for interactive components, and Tailwind CSS v4. The design draws inspiration from minimal typographic portfolios with a keyboard-themed color palette.

Features include a terminal-style loading screen, scroll-direction-aware header, content collections for writing and projects, and smooth scroll-triggered animations via Framer Motion.
