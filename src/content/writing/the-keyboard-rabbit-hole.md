It started with a Ducky keyboard that my coworker showed me after working my first job. It was a simple Ducky TKL keyboard with Cherry MX Black switches. I remember typing on it and saying that my fingers were getting tired within seconds (since the increased switch spring weight).

The only other mechanical keyboard I had experience with was a Reddragon RGB keyboard I had in college with Outemu blue switches. My tastes have since matured into much more manageable and more thoughtful typing experiences.

My current favorite keyboards are Unikorn R2.2 with Cherry MX Blacks, Chapter 1 65% with Gateron Cream Soda and a personal "Acrylikorn" I manufactured myself with Gateron CJ switches.

Since diving deeper and deeper into the `r/mk` community, I've discovered a whole new world of keyboard enthusiasts who share my passion for craftsmanship and attention to detail. From the intricate designs of custom keyboards to the subtle nuances of different switch types, there's always something new to learn and explore.

But this isn't really about keyboards. It's about what happens when you pay attention to the tools you use every day. When you start caring about the feel of a keypress, you start caring about the feel of everything — the clean line of a well-made pen, the texture of good paper, the response of a well-tuned interface.

Craft is contagious. Once you see it, you can't unsee it.
