It started with a keycap set. A friend showed me their custom mechanical keyboard, and something about the satisfying thock of each keypress caught my attention. Six months later, I own three custom boards and can debate the merits of linear vs. tactile switches for longer than anyone should.

But this isn't really about keyboards. It's about what happens when you pay attention to the tools you use every day. When you start caring about the feel of a keypress, you start caring about the feel of everything — the weight of a well-made pen, the texture of good paper, the response of a well-tuned interface.

Craft is contagious. Once you see it, you can't unsee it.
