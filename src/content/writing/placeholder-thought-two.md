A design system isn't a static artifact. It's not a PDF you hand off to engineering and walk away from. The best design systems are living, breathing things that evolve alongside the product they serve.

I've seen teams spend months building comprehensive design systems before writing a single line of product code. The result is always the same: a beautiful library of components that doesn't quite fit the reality of the product.

Start with the product. Extract patterns as they emerge. Let the system grow organically from real needs rather than hypothetical ones.

The best design systems are discovered, not designed.
