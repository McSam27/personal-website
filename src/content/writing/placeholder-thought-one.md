There's a certain vulnerability to sharing work before it's done. We're trained to present finished products — polished, complete, ready for critique. But there's something powerful about building in the open.

When you share your process, you invite others into the messy middle. The false starts, the pivots, the moments where everything clicks. It's not about performative transparency — it's about honest documentation.

The best work I've seen comes from people who aren't afraid to show the scaffolding. The rough sketches next to the final render. The git history that tells the real story.

Build in the open. Share the drafts. The work is better for it.
