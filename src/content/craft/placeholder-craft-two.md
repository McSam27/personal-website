A dark mode toggle that goes beyond the typical sun/moon icon swap. This implementation features smooth CSS custom property transitions, respects system preferences, and persists the user's choice across sessions.

The animation uses a circular mask reveal effect, expanding from the toggle button's position to fill the viewport. Built with vanilla CSS transitions and a sprinkle of JavaScript.
