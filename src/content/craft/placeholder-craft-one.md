A navigation menu built with Framer Motion spring physics. Features smooth expand/collapse animations, staggered item entrances, and a magnetic hover effect that follows the cursor.

Built with React, Framer Motion, and Tailwind CSS. The key insight was using `layout` animations for the container while independently animating each nav item with staggered delays.
